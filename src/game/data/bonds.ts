 * floor mechanism is enforced by `loyaltyFloor()` in
 * `relationshipEffects.ts`.

 * The array is intentionally empty — the OathBond type is kept for
 * `runtimeBonds` (dynamic entries: AI marriages, P11 trait bonds,
 * tactical-battle comradeship). New runtime bonds still go into
 * state.runtimeBonds; this static seed is retired.
