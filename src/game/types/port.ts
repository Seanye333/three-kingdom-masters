/**
 * A port is an independent map facility, NOT owned via its nearest city.
 * (RTK 14-style.) Players capture ports separately by sending forces to
 * the port's coordinates.
 *
 * - Owner can change independently of any city.
 * - HP tracks combat damage; 0 HP means the port is contested/sacked.
 * - connectedPortIds lists the sea routes (bidirectional) — naval
 *   movement is restricted to port-to-port hops along these edges.
 * - linkedCityId is the "home city" used for upkeep and trade flow.
